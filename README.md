- I have used Random Forest Classifier after doing the EDA

- Despite we have quite small dataset, our model had done very well with an accuracy of 70%, predicting the species very nicely

- I have also deployed the above model in the Heroku, the link to which is provided here - https://finaltestday1.herokuapp.com/

- There is a HTML & CSS file available in static and templates folder respectievly, which will be the front end part
